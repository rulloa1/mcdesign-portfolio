# Palette's Journal

## 2024-05-22 - Starting UX Improvements
**Learning:** Initial setup of the journal.
**Action:** Will document critical learnings here.

## 2024-05-22 - Global Navigation Accessibility
**Learning:** The application was missing a "Skip to Content" link, a critical accessibility feature for keyboard users to bypass navigation.
**Action:** Implemented a reusable, visually hidden (focusable) Skip Link in the Header component and added `id="main-content"` to main content areas. Future pages must include this ID.
